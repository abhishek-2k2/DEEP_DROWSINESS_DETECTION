        <h1>Traffic Flow Optimization System Using C++</h1>
        <p>Optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion in a smart city using real-time simulation and Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project simulates and optimizes traffic flow in a smart city using C++. It models city intersections and roads as a graph, where intersections are nodes, and roads are edges with traffic capacities and speeds. The system uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to calculate the shortest paths for vehicles and optimize traffic patterns to minimize congestion and improve traffic efficiency in real-time.

    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Graph Representation:</strong> The city is modeled as a graph with intersections as nodes and roads as edges, each road having specific capacity and speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</strong> The algorithm finds the shortest time to travel between intersections, considering road capacities and speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <strong>Traffic Management:</strong> The system reroutes vehicles based on congestion levels, ensuring smoother traffic flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <strong>Emergency Prioritization:</strong> Emergency vehicles are prioritized in real-time to ensure they pass through congested areas.
